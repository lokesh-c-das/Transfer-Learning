# Transfer-Learning
The aim of this project is to implement transfer learning (TL) technique by adopting a start-of-the-art deep Convolutioanl Neural Networks (DCNN) model namly ResNet and apply model ensemble techniques to acheive better generalization performance for the object recognition task using Tiny ImageNet dataset

# Implemented on:
- TensorFlow, Keras, Python
